# Module Map: Document publication flow (draft → upload → extract → review → publish)

## Source

PRD: [Issue #25 — Document publication flow: draft, upload, extract, review, publish](https://github.com/LucasACH/buscasam/issues/25).

Implements the `/mis-trabajos` slice end-to-end: single-step draft form, async extraction/indexing pipeline (PDF/DOCX/ODT + OCR gate), staged-metadata review, publish transaction with headline-fingerprint check, attachment management before and after publish. Lands the ADR-0006 (`blob_store`), ADR-0007 (`extract`), and ADR-0008 (`jobs`) chokepoints introduced in this PRD; extends `document_access` with the manageable-by-author predicate.

## Modules

### `core/blob_store`

**Interface:** Per ADR-0006 §3, sole surface:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BlobPutResult:
    sha256: str            # 64 hex chars
    bytes: int
    sniffed_mime: str      # libmagic over first 2 KB

async def put_stream(stream: AsyncIterator[bytes], *, max_bytes: int) -> BlobPutResult
async def open_for_send(sha256: str) -> AsyncIterator[bytes]
def internal_path(sha256: str) -> str          # for X-Accel-Redirect
async def exists(sha256: str) -> bool
async def delete(sha256: str) -> None          # GC only
```

Invariants: content-addressed sha256 with two-level shard (ADR-0006 §2); atomic write through `/blobs/.tmp/<uuid4>.partial` → `fsync` → `os.rename` (§4); rename collision = dedup hit, temp file unlinked; `put_stream` raises if streamed bytes exceed `max_bytes` (caller-supplied per file class — 50 MB main, 20 MB attachment); startup hook sweeps `.tmp/` older than 24 h. Architecture tests forbid application reads/writes/deletes outside this module (§3).

**Responsibilities:** Every byte hitting `/var/lib/buscasam/blobs/` goes through here. Owns the temp+rename protocol, the sharded path computation, MIME sniff via `libmagic`, the `X-Accel-Redirect` internal-path projection, and the orphan-sweep entry that `core/jobs` periodic task calls.

**Seams:** None at MVP. The local filesystem backend is the only implementation; ADR-0006 §1 locks it. An object-store adapter is post-MVP.

**Depth note:** The single auditable place bytes hit disk (PRD story 35). Deletion test: atomic-write semantics, sharding, dedup, and `X-Accel-Redirect` path computation would scatter across upload routes, GC workers, and download routes — each subtly drift-prone. ADR-0006 §3 locks the chokepoint.

---

### `core/extract`

**Interface:** Per ADR-0007 §2, two pure surfaces plus a synchronous probe:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExtractedDoc:
    text: str
    paragraph_breaks: list[int]    # ascending byte offsets
    page_breaks: list[int]         # empty for DOCX/ODT
    raw_metadata: dict

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class IndexableMetadata:
    abstract: str                  # may be ""
    keywords: list[str]            # 0..10
    fecha: date | None             # caller falls back to upload date

async def extract(sha256: str, mime: str) -> ExtractedDoc
def derive_metadata(doc: ExtractedDoc) -> IndexableMetadata
def probe_encrypted(head_bytes: bytes) -> None  # raises PDFEncryptionError → 415
```

Invariants: per-format dispatch is internal; callers pass `mime` (already sniffed by `blob_store`). The OCR gate (ADR-0007 §4) is an inline branch — if `pdfminer.six` yields < 100 chars/page averaged on a PDF, `extract` raises `OCRRequired(sha256)` so `core/jobs` can re-enqueue on the `ocr` queue; otherwise `extract` returns inline. `derive_metadata` is pure and synchronous. Empty body is not a failure (`abstract=""`, `keywords=[]`, `fecha=None`); ADR-0007 §9.

**Responsibilities:** Single chokepoint for "PDF/DOCX/ODT → text + offsets" and "text → abstract/keywords/fecha suggestions" (ADR-0007 §1). Owns the `pdfminer.six` / `python-docx` / `odfpy` dispatch, the `ocrmypdf` invocation on the `ocr` worker, the OCR threshold, the `Resumen|Abstract|...` regex, the YAKE configuration, the fecha cover-page heuristic, and the encrypted-PDF probe.

**Seams:** **Real seam.** Three format adapters today (PDF / DOCX / ODT), all materialized — the dispatcher is the contract. The OCR fallback is a branch inside the PDF adapter, not a separate adapter.

**Depth note:** Every format-specific weirdness — paragraph reconstruction from PDF character blocks, `python-docx` quirks, OCR threshold tuning, YAKE blocklist — concentrates here. Deletion test: indexer workers, candidate-failure detection, and the upload-edge encrypted-PDF rejection would each re-derive format probing.

---

### `core/chunk`

**Interface:**

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Chunk:
    body_text: str
    is_headline: bool
    chunk_seq: int

def chunk(doc: ExtractedDoc) -> list[Chunk]
def headline_chunk(title: str, abstract: str) -> Chunk
def headline_fingerprint(title: str, abstract: str) -> str  # stable hash
```

Invariants: ADR-0002 token budget respected; paragraph boundaries preferred (ADR-0001 §3); mid-paragraph splits only for oversized paragraphs. `chunk_seq` is 0 for headline, 1..n for body. `headline_fingerprint` is a stable normalized hash of `(title, abstract)` used by the publish gate.

**Responsibilities:** Sole owner of the body-splitting heuristic and the headline-chunk projection. Owns `headline_fingerprint` because the publish gate, post-publish edit reindex, and worker chunk-write all compare against the same canonical form.

**Seams:** None. One splitter, called by `core/jobs` task bodies (initial index + headline reindex) and by `core/documents.publish` (to compute the fingerprint of staged metadata for the gate check).

**Depth note:** Without isolation, the paragraph-boundary heuristic and the fingerprint hash would diverge between the indexing path and the publish gate — exactly the bug ADR-0007 §9 / ADR-0010 §4's gate guards against. Deletion test: re-implementations in `core/jobs` and `core/documents` would silently disagree on fingerprint formatting.

---

### `core/jobs`

**Interface:** Per ADR-0008 §3, typed enqueue helpers + Procrastinate task definitions:

```python
# enqueue (caller-facing)
async def enqueue_index_document(version_id: int) -> None
async def enqueue_ocr_index_document(version_id: int) -> None
async def enqueue_refresh_headline(version_id: int) -> None
async def enqueue_purge_deleted() -> None
async def enqueue_sweep_orphan_blobs() -> None

# task bodies (worker-facing, not imported by feature code)
@task(queue="default", retry=...)
async def index_document(version_id: int): ...
@task(queue="ocr", retry=..., concurrency=1)
async def ocr_index_document(version_id: int): ...
@task(queue="default", retry=...)
async def refresh_headline(version_id: int): ...
```

Invariants: enqueues use `queueing_lock` keyed per ADR-0008 §7 (`index:v{id}`, `headline:v{id}`, `maintenance:purge`, `maintenance:orphan`); execution `lock` matches; request-time enqueues defer through the active SQLAlchemy transaction's psycopg connection so domain row + job commit together (§1); `AlreadyEnqueued` is a no-op.

**Task body for `index_document` (canonical orchestration):**

```python
async def index_document(version_id: int) -> None:
    version = await documents._begin_indexing(version_id)
    if version is None:              # already completed retry
        return
    try:
        doc = await extract(version.sha256, version.mime)
    except OCRRequired:
        await enqueue_ocr_index_document(version_id)
        return
    except (PDFSyntaxError, BadZipFile, ...) as e:
        await documents.mark_failed(version_id, f"corrupted: {type(e).__name__}")
        return
    await _complete_indexing(version, doc)
```

`ocr_index_document` obtains the same locked start/no-op decision and calls the same private `_complete_indexing` helper after it runs `ocrmypdf` before `extract`. `refresh_headline` reads the candidate's persisted title/abstract, re-embeds the headline only, and calls `documents.write_headline(version_id, headline, embed, fp)`.

**Responsibilities:** Defines every async edge (task names, queues, retry policy from ADR-0008 §5, locks, periodic defers). Owns side-effect orchestration: extract → chunk → embed → persist call. Owns the OCR re-enqueue branch. Never opens transactions or writes domain rows directly — every persist goes through a `core/documents` function so DB invariants stay in one place.

**Seams:** None. Procrastinate is treated as an external boundary (like Authlib in `core/auth`); switching it out is post-MVP. Feature code never imports `procrastinate` (ADR-0008 §3).

**Depth note:** The single concentration point for "what async work exists and how it retries." Deletion test: queueing-lock keys, retry policies, and the OCR-handoff branch would scatter into per-feature ad-hoc tasks (ADR-0008 §3 explicitly forbids).

---

### `core/documents`

**Interface:** Single domain chokepoint per PRD §"Implementation Decisions". All DB mutations on `documents`, `document_versions`, `document_authors`, `document_attachments`, and the version-scoped `chunks` rows flow through here.

```python
# Author-facing (called by api/documents under require_authenticated + manageable check)

async def create_draft(
    user_ctx: UserCtx,
    *,
    title: str,
    area_path: str,
    document_type: str,
    visibility: Literal["publico", "interno", "privado"],
    external_authors: list[str],
    coauthor_user_ids: list[int],
) -> DocId
# - Inserts documents (publication_status='draft'),
# - Inserts document_authors: 1 owner + N pending registered + M external.
# - No version row yet.

async def attach_main_version(
    user_ctx: UserCtx,
    doc_id: DocId,
    blob: BlobPutResult,
    *,
    original_filename: str,
) -> VersionId
# - Inserts document_versions (index_status='pending', is_current=false).
# - Enqueues index_document(version_id) inside the same transaction (ADR-0008 §1).

async def update_draft_metadata(
    user_ctx: UserCtx,
    doc_id: DocId,
    *,
    title: str | None = None,
    abstract: str | None = None,
    keywords: list[str] | None = None,
    fecha: date | None = None,
    visibility: Literal[...] | None = None,
    area_path: str | None = None,
    document_type: str | None = None,
) -> None
# - Writes through to documents.* for top-level fields.
# - Writes staged_abstract/keywords/fecha on the candidate document_versions row.
# - If title or abstract changed, enqueues refresh_headline(version_id).

async def publish(user_ctx: UserCtx, doc_id: DocId) -> None
# - Loads candidate version; recomputes headline_fingerprint from current
#   documents.title + staged_abstract; raises PublishConflict (→ 409) if
#   index_status != 'indexed' OR fingerprint != stored headline_fingerprint.
# - Atomic SQL transaction (ADR-0006 §6): flips chunks.is_current,
#   document_versions.is_current, sets documents.publication_status='published'.
# - Copies staged_* into documents.abstract/keywords/fecha.
# - Enqueues fan_out_coauthor_invites (PRD #5 retrofits the send).

async def add_attachment(
    user_ctx: UserCtx,
    doc_id: DocId,
    blob: BlobPutResult,
    *,
    original_filename: str,
) -> AttachmentId
# - Enforces 5-attachment cap transactionally (ADR-0006 §7).

async def remove_attachment(user_ctx: UserCtx, doc_id: DocId, att_id: AttachmentId) -> None

async def get_draft_state(user_ctx: UserCtx, doc_id: DocId) -> DraftState
# Returns the polling payload: index_status, staged_*, headline_fingerprint_match,
# publish_gate_reason ('processing' | 'reindexing_headline' | 'processing_failed' | None),
# index_error. publish_gate_reason is None iff the publish call would succeed.

async def list_own_documents(user_ctx: UserCtx) -> list[OwnDocSummary]
# For /mis-trabajos. Owner + accepted-coauthor scope via manageable_where.

# Worker-facing (called by core/jobs task bodies; never by api/*)

async def load_candidate(version_id: int) -> CandidateVersion
async def write_indexed_candidate(
    version_id: int,
    body: list[Chunk],
    headline: Chunk,
    embeds: list[halfvec],
    meta: IndexableMetadata,
    headline_fingerprint: str,
) -> None
# Single transaction: inserts chunks (is_current=false, version_id=this),
# sets document_versions.index_status='indexed', staged_*, headline_fingerprint, indexed_at.

async def write_headline(version_id: int, headline: Chunk, embed: halfvec, fp: str) -> None
# Used by refresh_headline. Replaces the single is_headline=true chunk for this
# version while retaining its is_current value: a published-current refresh
# remains searchable; a staged replacement remains unsearchable.

async def mark_failed(version_id: int, error: str) -> None
# Transaction: index_status='failed', index_error=error,
# inserts notifications(kind='processing_failed', user_id=owner, ...) with unique event_key.
```

Private worker collaboration: `_begin_indexing(version_id)` row-locks the version, returns `None` for an already `indexed` completion, and otherwise moves the task into `processing` before extraction/OCR side effects. It is shared by default and OCR task implementations, not an enqueue Interface.

Invariants: every author-facing function takes `user_ctx` and applies `document_access.manageable_where` (owner | accepted) before any mutation; cross-user attempts return 404 (ADR-0010 §7). `publish` is the only function that writes to `documents.publication_status` or makes replacement chunks searchable. Chunks are keyed by `(version_id, chunk_seq)`, so current and candidate versions can both hold headline/body sequences; exactly the current version's chunks carry `is_current=true`. The 5-attachment cap, the headline-fingerprint check, the completed-indexing no-op transition, and the atomic publish SQL (ADR-0006 §6) are not exposed as building blocks. No worker function takes `user_ctx` — workers don't have one.

**Responsibilities:** Owns every domain mutation across the four document tables and the version-scoped `chunks` rows. Owns the publish transaction's SQL exactly (ADR-0006 §6). Owns the `processing_failed` notification insert. Owns the "post-publish metadata edits persist immediately + enqueue headline reindex" rule (PRD story 28-29). Owns the `publish_gate_reason` projection — server is the source of truth (PRD §"Implementation Decisions").

**Seams:** None. The PRD locks a single domain module: "core/documents (single domain module per session decision)". Splitting into `core/draft` / `core/version` / `core/attachment` was considered and rejected — the publish transaction, the attachment-cap invariant, and the manageable-by-author predicate would re-cross those boundaries on every call.

**Depth note:** Every lifecycle invariant from ADR-0010 §3-§4 lives here. Deletion test: the atomic publish SQL would scatter into the router; the 5-attachment cap would race under concurrent uploads; the publish-gate reason logic would diverge between the polling endpoint and the publish endpoint (PRD §"Implementation Decisions" — server is source of truth). One module so the gate's source-of-truth is genuinely one place.

---

### `api/documents` (FastAPI router)

**Interface:**

```
POST   /api/documents                                  → create_draft        (require_authenticated)
POST   /api/documents/{id}/upload                      → 202 / 415           (require_authenticated, manageable)
GET    /api/documents/{id}/draft                       → DraftStateDTO       (require_authenticated, manageable)
PATCH  /api/documents/{id}                             → 204                 (require_authenticated, manageable)
POST   /api/documents/{id}/publish                     → 204 / 409           (require_authenticated, manageable, owner-only)
POST   /api/documents/{id}/attachments                 → 201 / 413 / 415     (require_authenticated, manageable)
DELETE /api/documents/{id}/attachments/{att_id}        → 204                 (require_authenticated, manageable)
GET    /api/me/documents                               → list[OwnDocDTO]     (require_authenticated)
```

`POST /upload` is `multipart/form-data` direct to FastAPI (ADR-0004 §8). The route streams into `blob_store.put_stream(max_bytes=50_000_000)`, validates `sniffed_mime` against `{pdf, docx, odt}` (415 on mismatch), calls `extract.probe_encrypted(head_bytes)` for PDFs (415 on `PDFEncryptionError`), then `documents.attach_main_version(...)` and returns `202`. `PublishConflict` from `documents.publish` returns 409. Cross-user manageable check returns 404 to avoid existence leakage.

DTO shapes are ORM-free Pydantic v2 (ADR-0003 §6). `DraftStateDTO` matches the shape of `documents.get_draft_state`.

**Responsibilities:** HTTP / URL contract layer. Streams uploads through `blob_store`, performs the sync MIME + encrypted-PDF gate, shapes DTOs. Never opens transactions, never writes `documents`/`document_versions`/`document_authors`/`document_attachments` directly. Owns the `multipart` parsing and the synchronous 415 responses (PRD §"Implementation Decisions").

**Seams:** None. The eight endpoints share the same auth dep set and the same `core/documents` chokepoint; PRD-2's "earn extraction with a second caller" rule keeps them collocated.

**Depth note:** Thin by design — the policy bundle (publish gate, attachment cap, fingerprint check, manageable predicate) lives in `core/documents`. Deletion test for the router alone: trivial; for the upload route's MIME + encrypted gate: those guard `core/documents` against having to know about format-specific bytes. Keeping them at the edge preserves `core/documents` as pure DB logic.

---

### `app/mis-trabajos/page.tsx` (Next.js client page)

**Interface:** Renders at `/mis-trabajos`. Reads `useUser()`; on invitado, `router.replace("/login?next=/mis-trabajos")`. Fetches `GET /api/me/documents` via TanStack Query. Renders two sections: **Borradores** (publication_status='draft') and **Publicados**, each row linking to `/mis-trabajos/{id}/editar`. Header has a primary CTA to `/mis-trabajos/nuevo`. No SSR (ADR-0004 §3, PRD §"Out of Scope").

**Responsibilities:** Owner-scoped list, invitado guard, entry-point CTA.

**Seams:** None.

**Depth note:** Thin but earns its own page because the invitado redirect, the two-section layout, and the empty state ("Aún no subiste ningún trabajo — empezá con Nuevo trabajo") are the management-surface contract and need Playwright coverage independent of the draft form.

---

### `app/mis-trabajos/nuevo/page.tsx`

**Interface:** Single-step form (PRD story 4). RHF + Zod (ADR-0004 §8). Fields:

- `titulo` — required text.
- `area_path` — `AreasCascader` with `requireLeaf` (PRD story 5).
- `tipo` — select over the closed enum (PRD story 6).
- `visibilidad` — three-radio with inline copy per option (PRD story 7).
- `external_authors` — free-text, comma-or-line-separated (PRD story 8).
- `coauthor_user_ids` — `CoauthorPicker` (PRD story 9).
- `main_file` — `<input type="file" accept=".pdf,.docx,.odt">` (PRD story 11).

On submit: `POST /api/documents` (validation 422 surfaced inline) → on success, `POST /api/documents/{id}/upload` with the file (415 surfaced inline for encrypted-PDF / wrong mime, 413 for >50 MB) → on 202, `router.replace("/mis-trabajos/{id}/editar")`.

**Responsibilities:** Form schema (Zod), two-request submit orchestration, inline error rendering for the synchronous failure paths. Composes `AreasCascader({ requireLeaf: true })`, `CoauthorPicker`, the file picker.

**Seams:** None.

**Depth note:** Single concentration of "what a draft looks like before it has any candidate version." Deletion test: scatter the two-request submit and the 415-vs-413-vs-422 routing across reusable subcomponents and the error-recovery UX gets inconsistent.

---

### `app/mis-trabajos/[id]/editar/page.tsx`

**Interface:** Edit page. Composes:

- `useDraftState(id)` for staged metadata and interpreted lifecycle meaning (status pill copy, initial-publication phase, publish eligibility, gate copy, refresh after a mutation).
- **Initial-publication block.** On the initial path (`versions.length === 0`), the page reads `lifecycle.initialPhase` and, while it is not `ready`, renders only the heading, the status pill, and a centered full-page body — never the metadata form, suggestions, attachments, candidate/versions panels, coautores, the Publicar button, or (during `indexing`) Eliminar. `indexing` shows a blocking loader with Spanish copy ("el trabajo se procesa server-side; podés cerrar y volver"); `failed` shows the failure message (`lifecycle.gateMessage`) plus the owner-only Eliminar affordance. Polling unblocks the page automatically: when `initialPhase` becomes `ready` the full form mounts fresh (prefilled staged values). This replaces the former per-panel `showSuggestionsSpinner` overlay for the initial-indexing case — the spinner now only applies inside the already-published candidate flow.
- A metadata form (RHF + Zod, scoped to this page — not extracted) bound to `documents.get_draft_state`'s staged + author-entered fields. Save-on-blur PATCHes `/api/documents/{id}`.
- A suggestions panel that renders `staged_abstract`, `staged_keywords`, `staged_fecha` next to the editable inputs (PRD stories 17-18). It renders the loading meaning supplied by `useDraftState`, without inspecting indexing values.
- `AttachmentsPanel({ docId })` (PRD stories 22-25).
- **Publish** button — enabled only when the lifecycle view exposes `canPublish`; the inline message renders its Spanish `gateMessage`. On click: `POST /api/documents/{id}/publish`; a 409 (race) requests a draft refresh through the hook.
- Status pill at the top renders the lifecycle view's `statusLabel`: `Procesando…` / `Listo para publicar` / `Falló el procesamiento` (PRD story 16).

**Responsibilities:** The edit-page layout, the save-on-blur metadata PATCH wiring, and the suggestions↔staged↔final flow. It renders lifecycle meaning supplied by the draft-management Module; it does not know OpenAPI status/gate strings or the draft query cache contract.

**Seams:** None.

**Depth note:** The page is layout and form wiring only. Lifecycle interpretation now has locality in `useDraftState.ts`, so another draft-management surface can consume the same meaning without duplicating raw gate rules.

---

### `app/mis-trabajos/useDraftState.ts`

**Interface:**

```ts
useDraftState(docId: number) -> {
  state: {
    title; staged_abstract; staged_keywords; staged_fecha;
    lifecycle: {
      formSeedKey: string;
      statusLabel: string;
      showSuggestionsSpinner: boolean;
      gateMessage: string | null;
      canPublish: boolean;
      // Initial-publication path only (versions.length === 0): "indexing"
      // while index_status is pending/processing, "failed" on failure,
      // "ready" once indexed or a published version exists. The editar page
      // blocks all interaction behind a full-page loader/failure body until
      // this is "ready"; pages never read the raw index_status.
      initialPhase: "indexing" | "failed" | "ready";
    };
  } | undefined;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
  refresh(): Promise<void>;
}

useDraftAttachments(docId: number) -> {
  attachments: Attachment[];
  atCapacity: boolean;
  addAttachment(file: File): Promise<AttachmentMutationError | undefined>;
  removeAttachment(attachment: Attachment): Promise<AttachmentMutationError | undefined>;
}
```

Both hooks share TanStack Query against `GET /api/documents/{id}/draft`. The raw OpenAPI `index_status`, `publish_gate_reason`, `is_owner`, attachment payload, query key, and optimistic cache updates are Implementation details. Polling remains 3000 ms while the raw response denotes processing or headline reindexing, and is idle once publishable or failed. `useDraftAttachments` performs direct multipart upload because the generated body type cannot represent runtime `File`; it performs optimistic removal and rollback against the shared draft query.

**Responsibilities:** Request shape, polling cadence, raw lifecycle-to-view interpretation, refresh invalidation after metadata/publish races, and attachment cache synchronization. The backend remains the source of publish-gate truth; this Module owns its Spanish/UI projection.

**Seams:** None. Calls FastAPI only through the existing typed client, except the already-required multipart `File` browser request.

**Depth note:** Earns isolation because cadence, lifecycle interpretation, mutation invalidation, and attachment synchronization are one staged-publication rule bundle. Deletion test: pages and attachment widgets would again coordinate raw gate values and a shared query cache directly.

---

### `components/CoauthorPicker.tsx`

**Interface:** Props: `{ value: number[], onChange(ids: number[]) }`. Renders a typeahead input that debounces `GET /api/users/search?q=...` (returns up to ~10 matches: `{ user_id, name, email_local, picture_url }`). Selected entries appear as removable chips. Excludes the current user from results.

**Responsibilities:** User-search request shape, debounce, chip render, value plumbing. Does not know about `document_authors` rows — the parent form passes `value` to `POST /api/documents` and the backend writes `pending` rows.

**Seams:** None.

**Depth note:** Single visual contract for "pick a registered UNSAM user." Deletion test borderline — one caller at MVP (the `/nuevo` form) — but PRD #5's coauthor-invite re-add flow will reuse it, and the typeahead debounce + exclude-self rules are non-trivial enough that a Playwright spec wants a stable component to target.

---

### `components/AttachmentsPanel.tsx`

**Interface:** Props: `{ docId: number, canManage: boolean }`. Consumes `useDraftAttachments(docId)` and renders:

- Existing rows: `original_filename · sizebytes` + "Quitar" button (PRD stories 24-25). Click → `DELETE /api/documents/{docId}/attachments/{att_id}` → optimistic remove.
- Add affordance: `<input type="file" accept=".csv,.json,.txt,.py,.ipynb,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.gif,.zip">` (ADR-0006 §10 allowlist). Click → `POST /api/documents/{docId}/attachments` with the file. Disabled when `attachments.length === 5` with copy "Llegaste al máximo de 5 adjuntos" (PRD story 23). 413 surfaced inline as "Este adjunto pasa los 20 MB. Probá uno más chico."

`canManage` is true for owner + accepted coauthors per ADR-0010 §8 — the page passes whatever the server exposes; this component just hides the add/remove affordances when false.

**Responsibilities:** Attachment list + add + remove rendering, including Spanish copy for the 5-cap and upload/remove errors. Mutation requests and optimistic synchronization belong to draft management.

**Seams:** None.

**Depth note:** The 5-cap and the 20 MB limit remain user-visible here (PRD stories 22-23); cache and mutation behavior is no longer part of the component contract.

---

## Touched, not new

- **`core/document_access`** — gains `manageable_where(alias: str, user_ctx: UserCtx) -> tuple[str, dict]` returning the WHERE-clause body for owner-or-accepted-coauthor scope (ADR-0010 §8). Joins `document_authors` with `status IN ('owner', 'accepted') AND user_id = :user_id`. Used by every `api/documents` mutation route and by `list_own_documents`. The seam now has **three real adapters** (`invitado_where`, `readable_where`, `manageable_where`); the conceptual seam flagged in auth-sessions.md is now fully materialized.
- **`api/auth`** — adds `GET /api/users/search?q=<prefix>` guarded by `require_authenticated`. Returns up to ~10 `{user_id, name, email_local, picture_url}` rows from `users` with `ILIKE` prefix on `name` (and possibly `email_local`), excluding the current user. SQL inline in the router per the same "earn a domain module with a second caller" rule that keeps notifications inline.
- **`components/AreasCascader`** — gains `requireLeaf?: boolean` prop (PRD story 5). When `true`, the cascader's emitted `onChange` only fires after Materia (the leaf) is selected; partial selections render an inline error "Elegí una Materia". Other callers (the search filter) keep `requireLeaf={false}`.
- **`chunks` schema** — `version_id bigint not null references document_versions(id)` and `is_current boolean not null default false` implement ADR-0006 §6. Sequence identity is version-scoped: `UNIQUE (version_id, chunk_seq)` replaces `UNIQUE (doc_id, chunk_seq)`, permitting an indexed replacement to coexist with the current version before publish.
- **`AuthNav`** — gains a "Mis trabajos" entry in the authenticated dropdown linking to `/mis-trabajos`. One line.
- **`api/search` / `core/search_query`** — unchanged at the public interface; lexical, hybrid-semantic, and `recientes&q=` candidate CTEs now admit only `chunks.is_current=true`. Publish is the atomic point at which replacement text enters reader-visible search.

No cycles. `core/jobs` task bodies depend on `core/documents`, `core/extract`, `core/chunk`, `core/embed`; none of those depend on `core/jobs` (enqueue helpers are called by `core/documents` and `api/*`, not by other `core/*` modules). `api/documents` depends on `core/documents` and `core/blob_store`; `core/documents` depends on `core/document_access` and `core/jobs` (for enqueue). Frontend talks to FastAPI only through the typed OpenAPI client (ADR-0004 §6); no Server Components on `/mis-trabajos*` (ADR-0004 §3, PRD §"Out of Scope").

## Out of scope

- **Coauthor invitation send / accept / decline** — PRD #5. `create_draft` writes `document_authors` rows with `status='pending'`; PRD #5 owns the notification fan-out and the pending → accepted transition. The `enqueue_fan_out_coauthor_invites` helper exists in `core/jobs` (ADR-0008 §3) but is a no-op stub at this PRD's window; PRD #5 fills the task body and retrofits invites for any pending rows created here.
- **Main-file replacement** — PRD #6. No `PUT`/replace endpoint on `/api/documents/{id}/upload`. If the user uploaded the wrong file pre-publish, the only recovery before PRD #7 lands is operator-side; PRD #25 ships v1 only.
- **Author soft-delete, restore, 180-day purge** — PRD #7. The `documents.soft_deleted_at` column exists (ADR-0006 §5) but no endpoint writes it in this PRD. `enqueue_purge_deleted` is registered but the periodic defer is gated until PRD #7 (or behind a feature flag at MVP per ADR-0008 §9).
- **Download endpoints** (`GET /api/docs/{id}/download`, `GET /api/docs/{id}/attachments/{att_id}`) — PRD #4. ADR-0006 §8 defines them; PRD #25 only writes the rows they read.
- **Detail page** (`/docs/[id]`) — PRD #4. Publish makes the document readable; the public-facing surface lands in PRD #4.
- **Moderation reporting / hide / unhide** — PRD #8. The `moderation_hidden_at` column exists (ADR-0010 §10) and `readable_where` already filters on it; no producer here.
- **Server Components for `/mis-trabajos`** — explicitly rejected by ADR-0004 §3 + ADR-0005 §12. Client-only.
- **`core/draft` / `core/version` / `core/attachment` split** — rejected. PRD locks single `core/documents` chokepoint; splitting would force the publish transaction, the 5-attachment cap, and the manageable predicate to re-cross module boundaries on every call.
- **`api/attachments` separate router** — rejected. Two endpoints, both document-scoped, share the same `manageable` dep; collocating with `api/documents` matches the auth-sessions.md "earn extraction with a second caller" rule.
- **`api/users` separate router** — rejected. One read endpoint (`/api/users/search`) that already shares `require_authenticated` with the rest of `api/auth`; promotion to its own router waits for a second user-related endpoint (profile edit, etc.).
- **`core/notifications` domain module** — still rejected (auth-sessions.md out-of-scope). `core/documents.mark_failed` inserts the `processing_failed` notification inline; the existing inline SQL pattern in `api/notifications` is unchanged.
- **Inline "replace" of staged metadata back to the extractor's suggestion** — not surfaced in MVP. The user edits the field; if they want the suggestion back, they re-read it from the suggestions panel. PRD doesn't require a "revert to suggestion" button.
- **`MIN_SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY` recalibration** — unchanged from search-mvp.md; committed fixture only.
- **OCR'ing embedded images inside DOCX/ODT** — ADR-0007 §5; explicitly out.
- **Real Tesseract in unit tests** — ADR-0007 + PRD §"Testing Decisions"; one `ocr_slow`-marked integration test covers the OCR worker invocation.
- **Malware scanning on attachments** — ADR-0006 §10; out.
- **Background-task version of upload (FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`)** — ADR-0003 §4 explicitly bans; the index pipeline goes through `core/jobs` only.

## Further Notes

- Migration `0010` introduces version/chunk columns and backfills existing search rows; follow-up migration `0013` makes `chunks.version_id` mandatory and replaces document-scoped chunk sequence uniqueness with version-scoped uniqueness. Any legacy unversioned rows encountered during that upgrade are assigned a synthetic current indexed version before the constraint is tightened.
- The publish transaction (`core/documents.publish`) is the single SQL block from ADR-0006 §6, run inside one `async with session.begin()` so a crash between flips cannot leave the document partially published (PRD story 37).
- `write_headline` retains the target version's `is_current` flag. A refresh of the published current version updates searchable headline content; a refresh of an indexed candidate cannot expose it before publish.
- `headline_fingerprint` is a stable hash (e.g., `sha256(normalize(title) + "\x00" + normalize(abstract))[:32]`) so the publish gate, the post-edit reindex enqueue rule, and the worker can all compute the same value without coordination. `core/chunk.headline_fingerprint` is the single source.
- `publish_gate_reason` enum values are server-owned: `null` (publishable), `processing`, `reindexing_headline`, `processing_failed`. `app/mis-trabajos/useDraftState.ts` alone maps them to Spanish lifecycle copy and publish eligibility; pages do not inspect them. The server doesn't return user-facing strings.
- The `processing_failed` notification's `event_key` is `processing_failed:{version_id}` to use the existing unique index (ADR-0010 §9) — retries cannot create duplicates (PRD §"MVP acceptance tests" via ADR-0010 §12).
- ADR-0006 §10's MIME sniff happens inside `core/blob_store.put_stream` (bytes are streaming through there anyway); the upload route compares `BlobPutResult.sniffed_mime` against the main-file allowlist after the put completes and returns 415 + an inline message (encrypted PDF gets its own 415 message via `core/extract.probe_encrypted` checked before `put_stream`, so the blob is never written for an encrypted PDF).
